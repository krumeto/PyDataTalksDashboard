# PyDataTalksDashboard
PyData/SciPy Talks tend to be published in high number of different YouTube channels. This is a project to scrape those and present the videos in an easy to use way.

Project plan:
1. Create functions (perhaps a class) for the scrapping.
2. Create a DB/GoogleSheets/smthing else to store the output
3. Think of value-added grouping
